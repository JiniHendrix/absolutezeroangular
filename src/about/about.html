  <h1 class="about__header">Welcome to Absolute Zero!</h1>
  <p class="about__paragraph lato__reg">So, get this: you've spent your whole day working, travelling, hiking, training, or whatever else is that you do. It's
    finally time for you to sit down, take a breather, and enjoy your delicious lunch. Instead, what you get is a stale and
    lukewarm disappointment.
    <br>
    <br> Does this sound familiar to you? Because that's how it was for us, day after day, for quite some time. It was during
    one of these lackluster lunches that the idea for Absolute Zero was born - we had had enough of that! It was time to
    take things into our own hands.
    <br>
    <br> We realized that the need for a practical and reliable way to keep our meals, lunches, and drinks chilled throughout
    the day was becoming painfully apparent with each passing day. The rest is, as they say, history!</p>
    <br>
    <h1 class="about__header"> Who Are We?</h1>
  <p class="about__paragraph lato__reg">We're a Los Angeles - based company with a singular purpose in mind: we aim to provide our customer with a brand of high
    quality, reliable bags that will make their day-to-day life and outdoor excursions easier and more enjoyable. Our bags
    are made by everyday people, for everyday people - that's why quality, customer service, and integrity are paramount
    to us!</p>
    <br>
  <h1 class="about__header">What Do We Offer You?</h1>
  <p class="about__paragraph lato__reg">We're aware, however, that "just" providing premium quality products is not nearly enough - not in today's fiercely demanding
    world. That's why we also pride ourselves in pushing the boundaries of conventional product design, introducing new innovative
    ideas, smart features, styles, and colors, and making them a joy to use.
    <br>
    <br> And we're glad to be able to say that all that attention to detail and quality actually pays off! We already enjoy
    a growing portfolio of satisfied and happy customers, which bears testimony to our core values -quality and reliability,
    combined with a sense of responsibility and a love for life!</p>
